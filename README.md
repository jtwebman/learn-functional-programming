# Learn Function Programming in JavaScript with Node.js

Do you want to learn functional programming but don't want to learn a whole
new language?

If so then this is the repo for you! I am thinking about making this a book
but for now this will just be an outline and a bunch of exercises you can
work though.

Each chapter will cover a part of learning function programming. Though it is
meant to work through in order you can feel free to work through it in any
order. If I reference something from a previous chapter I will put a link to it.

This project expects that you understand a basic node.js and and how to use
git. If you need to learn more about these checkout the following.
